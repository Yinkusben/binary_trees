/**
 * binary_tree_insert_right - a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node 
 * @parent: A pointer to the node to insert the right-child in.
 * @value: The data to store in the newly created node.
 *
 * Return: If parent is NULL or an error occurs - NULL.
 *         Otherwise - a pointer to the new node.
 *
 * Description: If parent already has a right-child, the new node
 *              takes its place and the old right-child is set as
 *              the right-child of the new node.
